//  1. Arithmetic Operators
// Problem:
// Write a program that reads two integers and prints their:

// Sum
// Difference
// Product
// Quotient
// Remainder
// 2. Relational Operators
// Problem:
// Write a program that takes two integers as input and calculates whether:







// The first number is greater than the second.
// The first number is less than the second.
// The numbers are equal.
// Print the results as 1 for true and 0 for false.
// 3. Logical Operators
// Problem:
// Write a program that takes three integers and prints:

// The result of (num1 > 0) && (num2 > 0) && (num3 > 0)
// The result of (num1 % 2 == 0) 
//  (num3 % 2 == 0)
// The negation of (num1 > num2)
// 4. Mixed Arithmetic and Relational Operators
// Problem:
// Write a program that takes two numbers, calculates their sum, and checks:

// If the sum is greater than 50.
// If the sum is less than or equal to 50.
// Print the results directly as 1 (true) or 0 (false).
// 5. Logical Operators with User Input
// Problem:
// Write a program that reads two numbers and checks:

// If both numbers are positive.
// If at least one number is even.
// If neither number is zero.
// Print the results as 1 for true and 0 for false. 
int a =10;
(a>=0)?printf("%d is positive", a):printf("%d is negative", a);
